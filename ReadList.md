# Aaron's Reading List For Leaders
---

## For new managers, or managers new to development
*These recommendations are for individuals new to people leadership, new to software development, or both.* 

### [Resilient Management, Lara Hogan](https://resilient-management.com/)
This is a really good book for first time leaders. When I first started in management, I looked high and low for resources that would give me a good foundation. I never found it. I read this book about a year ago, and this is the book I would have written. Although it is for new managers, it has some great practical reminders for seasoned ones. 

### [Clean Coder, Uncle Bob Martin](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)
This is a classic from one of the legends of the industry, Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob).  It's written for developers, but that should scare even non-developing managers.  It's like listening to a very senior developer explain to a junior developer the basic expectations of their craft. It helps managers set reasonable and appropriate expectations for individual developers. 

### [The Nature of Software Development, Ron Jeffries](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Software-Development-Simple-Valuable/dp/1941222374)
Somewhere, somehow agile got complicated. It's not supposed to be. Here's an easy breakdown of operating in agile. 

## For Developing Managers
*These recommendations are for people who have been in management for a while that are looking to up their game.* 

### [Silos, Politics and Turf Wars - Patrick Lencioni](https://www.amazon.com/Silos-Politics-Turf-Wars-Competitors/dp/0787976385)
Lencioni is famous for Five Dysfunctions of a Team. That's also a great book (required reading!) but it's not his best work, this one is. Hint: It's about goal setting. 

### [The Mythical Man Month, Fred Brooks](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959)
You absolutely will not be a successful manager in software development without understanding this principle: Adding developers to a late project makes it later.  Also, it's dated and it's full of hubris about how to do development correctly, which is mostly entirely wrong IMHO. Which makes it worth learning from. 

### [Accelerate, Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339)
The science (and measures) behind building and scaling high performance technology organizations

## For the Advanced Leader looking to Excel
*These are more advanced reading. I'm not saying they are easy reads, but they are really valuable.* 

### [The Leadership Challenge, James Kouzes and Barry Posner](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Challenge-Extraordinary-Things-Organizations/dp/0470651725)
This is the authoritative guide to leadership. There are one million books on leadership. If you read only one, this is the one. It can read a little like a text book, so if that's not your thing,  brace for impact.  Take the LPI assessemnt if you can. 

### [Getting to Yes, Roger Fisher and William Ury](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiate-Agreement-Without/dp/0743526937)
A good leader can negotiate in good faith, and win.  This book is a detailed look at how. It taught me to never get locked into a postion, which immediately made me a better communicator and a better negotiator. I side effect was it helps me keep disagreements from becoming awkward. 

### [The Innovators Dilemma, Clayton Christensen](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244)
Part of a successful company at the top of the market? This is how you will lose. Every. Single. Time.  

## Stories of Leadership
*Easier reading of real, true stories of leadership. Many, many great lessons to be learned from other's experiences* 

### [A Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, David McCullough](https://www.amazon.com/Path-Between-Seas-Creation-1870-1914/dp/0671244094)
The most ambitious engineering exercise in the history of mankind, littered with failed and successful profiles in leadership.  

### [Young Men and Fire, Norman Maclean](https://www.amazon.com/Young-Men-Fire-Norman-Maclean/dp/0226500624)
What is more important? Competence or Compassion?  In this story, young men are led into a forest fire by an experienced, capable leader. The leader survives,  most of the others die. One of my most favorite (and tragic) leadership stories. Warning: Hard to read

### [Theodore Roosevelt and the Making of American Leadership, Jon Knokey](https://www.amazon.com/Theodore-Roosevelt-Making-American-Leadership-ebook/dp/B016HBYVA0)
A friend of mine wrote this, and it is worth recommending.  TR was the consumate leader of his time.
