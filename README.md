# Senneff: A How-To Guide

Way back in time when I was in high school I would poke around on my Gateway 386 that was connected to the "internet" (sketchy bulletin boards and FTP sites).  This was the amazing era of shareware, when one would painstakingly dowload some new widget over a 56kbs modem that would tie up the family phone line for hours.   Now,  good shareware always had a handy README.txt file that would describe in fair detail how to interact with this software exactly - how to install it, how not to break it, how to make it useful.  Shareware has more or less died off,  but the README lives on.  

This is my README. It's not about a piece of software, it's about how I operate. A How-To guide of sorts.   

## How We Communicate
First, I expect you to proactively communicate with me. That is one of your core job responsibilities. I
cannot help you, I can’t know what you are thinking, I can’t know what problems you are having, I can’t
know if you are about to make a grave mistake if you do not communicate with me, and I cannot help you
develop and grow your career without us communicating. Regularly.

Early on in our relationship, we will have a regular one on one, typically once a week.   At some point, I will ask you to decide how frequently you want to do one on ones and take ownership of the meeting. At that point, how you handle one on ones is up to you. People have different preferences on how they communicate, and that's fine.  For reference, in the past I have had people who like to do a weekly one on one for: 30 minutes. Some people have preferred to do that every other week, or perhaps for an hour at a time. Some people like it to be more ad-hoc and set them up whenever the mood strikes them. Some people just do “flybys” on a regular basis and not be controlled by a calendar.   How you want to do one on ones is up to you. Whatever you chose, I just ask that you *proactively communicate with me*.  One helpful thing to me is to just drop things that are on your mind in our 1:1 thread in Slack ahead of time. I will do the same as stuff pops into my head. It just helps us use our time wisely. 

Communication comes in a lot of forms. I am on Slack consistently. You can tag me in a group
forum or hit me up 1:1 there. You can text me as much as you like. If you have other digital forums you prefer, we can try those. I once had a developer that preferred to just DM me on twitter when he needed to chat, and another that used SnapChat.  All of those are perfectly fine ways to keep proactively communicating in frequent, small doses.  

I should warn you that for me email is the worst possible way to communicate with me, I don't do the inbox zero thing and I might go a very long time before seeing you sent me something important.  Keep that in mind when using that medium. 


## What I Believe and How I Work

### People Come First. 
Some technology leaders like to focus on the technology. Some care less about the technology but bring a lot of passion about the product itself.  Some are very operational and focus on efficiency or metrics.  It might be helpful to know that I am not any of those. 

In my view, *my primary responsibility at Church Community Builder is to build and maintain an environment where great people want to be*.  That's where my heart is at, it is what our organization needs, and it is what drives me. 

You do not have to have the same bent to be successful working with me. In fact, I need people who love the technology, who care about the product, and who look for inefficiency.   However, in your leadership role (we are all leaders) you also contribute singificantly to the culture.  If you do everything I ask you to do well and more but aren’t contributing positively to the environment, we have a huge problem.

### We Live and Die by Feedback, Pt I. 
*You need to be able to tell me when I am being an idiot.*  That’s the
only way this organization is going to work. I don’t always know the right answer and sometimes I make
poor, sub optimized or just unwise decisions that frustrate you. It may be that it’s my *lack*  of decisions
that is frustrating you. I assure you, I am not doing this on purpose.  In all likelihood I just don’t realize
how my behavior is impacting the organization. Many times, the only way I will know that is if you tell me I am
being an idiot. For the health and effectiveness of the entire operation, you need to be willing to talk to
me about the hard things, regularly.  There are never going to be any bonus points awarded for agreeing with me, neither will there be any demerits for voicing your concerns.  I promise you I want to hear what is on your mind, that's part of the deal. I won’t always agree or take action, but I will promise I will not shoot the messenger. Be brave and tell me when I am not living up to your expectations. Sometimes in order to tease out those things, I will ask you to bring a list of things to our one on one that you wish I did better.      

### We Live and Die by Feedback, Pt II. 
Part of my job is to give you regular feedback, good and bad. I try
to practice coaching on the spot – when I see something to give you feedback on I will pull you aside and
give it to you. We will also have regular reviews at a minimum of annual intervals where we will cover feedback. I
will always give you some feedback in those sessions, provided you are willing to do the same for me.  

### You’re an accomplished adult that doesn’t need to be micromanaged. 
I will ask you to do things, I will set out policies that will apply to you, I will have people come to me with problems and I will direct them to you to get them fixed when it makes sense, I will establish goals with you, and in every way conceivable will send work your way and make you feel empowered and responsible for it. In all of that, I  respect that you are the DRI and are accountable to outcomes.  As a result, I will rarely ask you for follow up – by that I mean status reviews, slides, update meetings, presentations or TPS reports. Because you're an adult and leader I can and will safely assume you know what you are doing, I can trust you to prioritize, and believe that you get stuff done when it needs to be done. 

Occasionally I will ask you for clarity on how things are going, but for the most part, I will only come to you when I see evidence that something is not getting done or the wheels are falling off. I do occasioanlly get frustrated when I ask for things to get done, they don’t get done,  and I don’t know why. And that’s why you need to be proactively communicating.

## The Errata
I used to be an embedded programmer. Back then one of the most important tools on my shelf was the
programming manual for the microprocessor we were using. There was chapter after chapter on how to
effectively program the micro, but the most important stuff was always at the end in the errata – “the stuff
that doesn’t exactly work like you might expect.” This is my errata.
1. I may ask you to do something that isn’t crisply defined. When that happens you should ask me
for both clarification and importance. These questions can save everyone a lot of time and angst.
2. I respond better to direct requests. “Do you think we should do something about….?” is an
opinion question and it will usually never occur to me that you are asking me to take some action.
“I need you to send an email to….” Is a direct request that is obviously actionable to me.
3. I like to let controversies play out, it’s part of figuring out how to work as a team. Bright people
often disagree and the process of managing disagreement is a differentiating leadership skill that requires practice. Therefore,  I'm fine letting people work through the messy process of managing disagreement - *I actually enjoy watching it play out.*
There does reach a point where controversies within our group reach a natural conclusion, and
we just need a decision to keep everyone sane. If it's not clear who the DRI is at that point then just tell me when we have reached that point and I will weigh
in and close the debate. Otherwise, I tend to let it continue to play out.
4. I don’t provide negative feedback in a group setting, even when it is obviously needed. If done
well you will not observe me providing negative feedback to any one individual other than
yourself, ever. When the wheels are falling off in a meeting or event or process and you don’t
see me doing anything, you might view my response as disengagement or the lack of awareness.
Please be aware it’s neither, I’m probably taking a mental note of some feedback I need to
provide after the meeting. It’s just something I prefer to handle one on one.
5. I am and will be effusive with positive feedback both group and private settings.   
6. I believe in the minimum viable process. At some point in time someone decided the best means of air travel was a dirigible airship. That was the best practice of the time. If we applied the standard management process of "we use best practices around here," then there never would have been any room for the Wright Brothers to convince us that winged airplanes were a better way to go. In the same way, I am much less motivated by best practices and much more so by outcomes. I
want you to figure out the processes that work best for you and your areas of responsibility, and you have the freedom to experiment. In the rare event that a clear process structure is needed - and sometimes it is - you'll hear that from me. 
7. I believe strongly in work life balance and I work to practice it.  If I am overloaded I tend to come in early to keep my commitment to my wife and kids to be with them in the evening.  As a leader, I also don't want to model staying late to our group.  
8. If you see me on my phone during a meeting, please tell me to stop. So rude.
